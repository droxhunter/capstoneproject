About the final project assessment
This course's graded assessment consists of three exercises and one final graded quiz. 

The purpose of the assessments 
The primary purpose of the assessments is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course.  

Most importantly, they help you establish which topics you have mastered and which topics require further focus before completing the course. 

Ultimately, the graded assessments are designed to help you make sure that you can apply what you have learned. 

What to expect from the exercises and peer review 
You have encountered exercises, knowledge checks, in-video questions and other assessments throughout this course. 

Nothing in the exercises will be outside the scope of what you have already learned, so you should be well-placed to succeed. 

You will combine the skills and knowledge that you applied throughout the course and use them to: 

Connect the Little Lemon restaurant back-end to MySQL 

Set up a Little Lemon restaurant booking API 

Insert booking data in the database via the  booking API

These tasks will all be assessed in the peer review submission.
